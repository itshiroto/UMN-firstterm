There's a lot advantages than the disadvantages according to this article. At first, we can see Social media usage by Gen Z has evolved rapidly over these years. These evolvement affecting how Gen Z speaks, consuming content, and how they expressed themselves. We can see this by the data that was presented in the article. There's over 50 percent Gen Z that spending more than $US30 a month on online shopping, and it will increased by 2030. Aside from that, we can see that Gen Z now more actively aware on global issues like climate changes, racial diversity and much more.

But there's disadvantages too like how Gen Z's action on responding those issues (in my opinion) very biased. Most Gen Z don't want their opinion to be wrong, they always want to be right. This action can cause many Gen Z will be affected by hoax or other radical opinion easily. They also usually not researching their materials good enough, only supporting what their influencer thought good. And that's really an issue right now happening in social media like Twitter and Reddit.

But overall, there's a lot more advantages than disadvantages that I could find in Gen Z's change on social media usage. We can see improvement on economy; especially in e-commerce and even Cryptocurrency. It's a really good cause for national and international economic growth. And also now there's more people that supporting more global issues that we faced right now.
