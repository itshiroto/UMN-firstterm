revealed that Gen Z spends more time on social media than Millennials, at 2 hours 55 minutes per day.

Young people are demanding a voice in decisions that affect their lives, and social media is helping them amplify it. Whether its commerce, marketing or social justice, Gen Z is proving to be the agent of change. :q
